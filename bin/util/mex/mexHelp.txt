MEX   Compile MEX-function

   Usage:
       mex [options ...] file [files ...]

   Description:
       MEX compiles and links source files into a shared library called a 
       MEX-file, executable from within MATLAB. It also builds executable
       files for standalone MATLAB engine and MAT-file applications.
   
   Command Line Options Available on All Platforms:
       -c
           Compile only. Creates an object file but not a MEX-file.
       -client engine
           Build standalone MATLAB engine or MAT-file application.
       -compatibleArrayDims
           Build a MEX-file using the MATLAB Version 7.2 array-handling
           API, which limits arrays to 2^31-1 elements. This option is the
           default, but in the future the -largeArrayDims option will be 
           the default.
       -D<name>
           Define a symbol name to the C preprocessor. Equivalent to a
           "#define <name>" directive in the source. Do not add a space
           after this switch.
       -D<name>=<value>
           Define a symbol name and value to the C preprocessor. Equivalent
           to a "#define <name> <value>" directive in the source. Do not
           add a space after this switch.
       -f <optionsfile>
           For advanced users. Specify location and name of the MEX
           configuration file to use. Overrides MEX's default compiler
           selection mechanism.
       -g
           Create a MEX-file containing additional symbolic information for
           use in debugging. This option disables MEX's default behavior of
           optimizing built object code (see the -O option).
       -h[elp]
           Display this message.
       -I<pathname>
           Add <pathname> to the list of directories to search for #include
           files. Do not add a space after this switch.
       -l<name>
           Link with object library. On Windows, <name> expands to
           "<name>.lib" or "lib<name>.lib". On Linux, to "lib<name>.so".
           On Mac, to "lib<name>.dylib". Do not add a space after this
           switch.
       -L<folder>
           Add <folder> to the list of folders to search for
           libraries specified with the -l option. Do not add a space 
           after this switch.
       -largeArrayDims
           Build a MEX-file using the MATLAB large-array-handling API. This
           API can handle arrays with more than 2^31-1 elements when
           compiled on 64-bit platforms. -compatibleArrayDims is the
           default option.
       -n
           No execute mode. Display commands that MEX would otherwise
           have executed, but do not actually execute any of them.
       -O
           Optimize the object code. Optimization is enabled by default and
           by including this option on the command line. If the -g option
           appears without the -O option, optimization is disabled.
       -outdir <dirname>
           Place all output files in folder <dirname>.
       -output <resultname>
           Create MEX-file named <resultname>. The appropriate MEX-file
           extension is automatically appended. Overrides MEX's default
           MEX-file naming mechanism.
       -setup <lang>
           Change the default compiler to build <lang> language MEX-files.
           When this option is specified, no other command line 
           input is accepted.
       -silent
           Suppress informational messages. The mex function still reports
           errors and warnings, even when you specify -silent.
       -U<name>
           Remove any initial definition of the C preprocessor symbol
           <name>. (Inverse of the -D option.) Do not add a space after
           this switch.
       -v
           Verbose mode. Display the values for important internal
           variables after all command line arguments are considered.
           Displays each compile step and final link step fully evaluated.
       <name>=<value>
           Override default setting for variable <name>. This option is 
           processed after all command line arguments are considered. 

   Command Line Options Available Only on Windows Platforms:
       @<rspfile>
           Include contents of the text file <rspfile> as command line
           arguments to MEX.
